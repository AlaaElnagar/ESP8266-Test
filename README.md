## Introduction
![Alt text](https://openthread.google.cn/images/ot-contrib-espressif.png?authuser=2)

wifi SOC (system on a chip) produced by Espressif Systems . It is an highly integrated chip designed to provide full internet connectivity in a small package.

## What is it good for?

ESP8266 can be used as an external Wifi module, using the standard AT Command set Firmware by connecting it to any microcontroller using the serial UART, or directly serve as a Wifi-enabled micro controller, by programming a new firmware using the provided SDK.

The GPIO pins allow Analog and Digital IO, plus PWM, SPI, I2C, etc.

This board has been around for almost a year now, and has been used mostly in IoT contexts, where we want to add connectivity for example to an Arduino project. A wide adoption has been facilitated by the very modest price, ranging from 2.50 to 10 USD depending on the features offered by the manufacturers.

## Some example projects:

* Temperature logging and Web UI
